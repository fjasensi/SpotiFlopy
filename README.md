## **Installation Instructions** üîß

### 1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
```

## 2. Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Set Up Spotify API Credentials:
1. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add your Spotify API credentials in the .env file:

```env
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback/
```
**Note**: Since I am running from Windows with WSL2, it is necessary to obtain the IP address of WSL. To do this, run the following command in the Linux terminal: `hostname -I`. This will be the IP address that we configure in the Spotify Developers app and set in the `.env` file.
## 4. Run the script
```bash
python main.py
```

The first time you run the script, it will open a browser for you to authenticate with Spotify. After that, it will handle token refreshes automatically.

In the console, a URL will appear that you need to open to log in to Spotify. Once you have completed the login, it will redirect to an address like: `http://172.1.23.45:8888/callback/?code=AbbasdfT......`. The browser may say that the page is not accessible, but you need to copy this URL and paste it into the console.
